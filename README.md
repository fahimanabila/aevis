# AEVIS an Embedded System Project based :fish:
AEVIS (Automatic Feeder for Various Fishes) built with Arduino UNO and C Language
## :white_check_mark: Background
> Feeding for fish is required to consider the quality of the feed and the quantity/dose of feed, often due to the busyness of some people who forget to feed their pet fish as a result many novice cultivators fail because they do not meet the nutritional needs of the fish properly. Therefore the author has the idea to make an Automatic Feeder for Various Fishes (AEVIS) for pet fish in aquariums, with an automatic system, fish owners don't need to feed fish manually.

## :white_check_mark: Problem Identification
> 1. When the owner of the aquarium is busy or traveling for a long period of time, no one feeds the fish so there is a risk of losses such as the fish that are kept die quickly.
> 2. The tendency of keepers to neglect to provide fish feed (human error)
> 3. Inaccuracy in giving fish expert measurements by keepers causing poor fish health.

## :white_check_mark: Formulas 
> 1. How is the application of technology that can provide fish feed automatically?
> 2. What are the working steps of making Automatic Feeder For Various Fishes as a technology to fulfill nutrition for fish?
> 3. What are the tools and materials to make Automatic Feeder For Various Fishes?

## :white_check_mark: Purpose and Aim
> 1. To design a tool that can automatically regulate the fulfillment of fish nutrition
> 2. To help novice entrepreneurs manage fish farming in aquariums
> 3. For knowledge materials for readers who have an interest in fish farming, especially regarding microprocessor and microcontroller technology in aquariums
> 4. As a performance of the Automatic Feeder for Various Fishes (AEVIS) prototype
> 5. As a form of student service (agent of change) in the field of technology in society, especially MSMEs
